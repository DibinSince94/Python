Python dataframes are two-dimensional labeled data structures from the pandas library, resembling tables or spreadsheets. They consist of rows and columns, where each column can hold different types of data. Dataframes offer powerful tools for data manipulation, analysis, and exploration, including functions for filtering, grouping, aggregating, and merging data. They are commonly used in data science, machine learning, and data analysis projects due to their flexibility and efficiency in handling large datasets.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Iris dataset involves analyzing and visualizing the characteristics of the dataset to gain insights into the data's structure and relationships. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and contains measurements of various iris flowers.

Data Preprocessing / Clean the Data, 4. Fit the Model & Predict, Check the Accuracy
Matplotlib is a powerful plotting library in Python widely used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations. It offers a wide range of plotting functions and customization options, making it suitable for various tasks.
NumPy is a fundamental library in Python for numerical computing, particularly for handling arrays and matrices.
Pandas is a powerful and versatile library in Python for data manipulation and analysis.
Python classes provide a powerful mechanism for organizing code, modeling real-world entities, and implementing object-oriented principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. They are widely used in Python for building complex systems and applications.
Python functions provide a way to encapsulate and reuse code, promoting code organization, readability, and maintainability. They are essential building blocks in Python programming and play a crucial role in modularizing and structuring code.
Regular expressions(RegEx) are a versatile tool for pattern matching and text manipulation in Python. They are widely used in data cleaning, text processing, parsing, and validation tasks across various domains. With practice and familiarity, regex can greatly enhance your ability to work with textual data efficiently and effectively.
